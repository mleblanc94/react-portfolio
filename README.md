# react-portfolio
A portfolio made with React to show off my best projects.

## Description

- I was motivated to create this application because it was a great opportunity to learn all about creating React applications. React was really a new concept for me and totally different than Front End mechanics I have used before, so it was great.
- I created this project to work on React and deployment skills. I think this was a great way for me to get familiar with the way React applications are created.
- By creating this application, I solved the issue of learning how React applications are created.
- Through doing this activity, I learned more about using React and was able to see their use in real world applications!
